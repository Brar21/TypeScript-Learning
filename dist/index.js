var age = 20; //just after diclare a variable we also mention type of varible so further we can't change this
//age = 'a';  // bad line or bad coding
//Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number' when we try to make age as a string.
// We var instead using let because Typescript  use var o declare a variable  and Javascript make it as Let
