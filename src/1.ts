let num: number = 123_456_789; //also we write as 123456789;
let tutorial: string = 'Typescript-Basic';
let is_uploaded: boolean = true;
let level; //hover on it you can see it_show type "any" means it can be number, boolean, string.
//example
//level = 1;
//level = "varinder";
function print(data) //we can remove this under line on "data" just press ctrl+p if you have window and select tsconfig.json and 
{
     console.log(data)
 }
//bad practice because doing this whole typescript ideas is fail, So, never do this;
