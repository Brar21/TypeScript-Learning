var age: number = 20; //just after diclare a variable we also mention type of varible so further we can't change this

//age = 'a';  // bad line or bad coding
 //Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number' when we try to make age as a string.

 // We var instead using let because Typescript  use var o declare a variable  and Javascript make it as Let

//debugging we add breakpoint att line:12 and it will stop at 15 //click debugg tab fourth option on left side
